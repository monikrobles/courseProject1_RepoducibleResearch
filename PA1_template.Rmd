# Reproducible Research:  Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r loaddata}
unzip(zipfile="repdata_data_activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
total.steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(total.steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
averages <- aggregate(x=list(steps=data$steps), by=list(interval=data$interval),
                      FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE)
ggplot(data=averages, aes(x=interval, y=steps)) +
    geom_line() +
    xlab("5-minute interval") +
    ylab("average number of steps taken")
```

On average across all the days in the dataset, the 5-minute interval contains
the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
averages[which.max(averages$steps),]
```

## Imputing missing values

There are many days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as `NA`). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

```{r how_many_missing}
missing <- is.na(data$steps)
# How many missing
table(missing)
```

All of the missing values are filled in with mean value for that 5-minute
interval.

```{r}
# Replace each missing value with the mean value of its 5-minute interval
fill.value <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- c(steps)
    else
        filled <- (averages[averages$interval==interval, "steps"])
    return(filled)
}
filled.data <- data
filled.data$steps <- mapply(fill.value, filled.data$steps, filled.data$interval)
```
Now, using the filled data set, let's make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate the mean and median total number of steps.

```{r}
total.steps <- tapply(filled.data$steps, filled.data$date, FUN=sum)
qplot(total.steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="total number of steps taken each day")
mean(total.steps)
median(total.steps)
```

Mean and median values are higher after imputing missing data. The reason is
that in the original data, there are some days with `steps` values `NA` for 
any `interval`. The total number of steps taken in such days are set to 0s by
default. However, after replacing missing `steps` values with the mean `steps`
of associated `interval` value, these 0 values are removed from the histogram
of total number of steps taken each day.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
##### 1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ??? ???weekday??? and ???weekend??? indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```{r}
filled.data$dateType <-  ifelse(as.POSIXlt(filled.data$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), 'weekend', 'weekday')
```

##### 2. Panel plot containing a time series plot


```{r}
averagedData <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dateType, data=filled.data, mean)
ggplot(averagedData, aes(interval, steps)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    facet_grid(dateType ~ .) +
    xlab("5-minute interval") + 
    ylab("avarage number of steps")
```
